## Usage in Laravel

### 1. Store the Template
Place the `index.html` content in a Blade view (e.g., `resources/views/emails/fashion-shop.blade.php`).

### 2. Handle Assets
Move the content of `assets/` to your public directory (e.g., `public/vendor/mail-templates/fashion-shop/`) and update the paths in the HTML to use the `asset()` helper.

### 3. Send Email
```php
Mail::to($user)->send(new \App\Mail\GenericEmail([
    'view' => 'emails.fashion-shop',
    'data' => [
        // Your dynamic data here
    ]
]));
```
